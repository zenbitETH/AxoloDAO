# 🧬 AxoloDAO (WIP)

AxoloDAO is a conservation-focused [microDAO](https://paragraph.com/@zenbit-2/how-to-onboard-startups-into-ethereum) dedicated to protecting **Ambystoma species in Mexico** through public digital infrastructure, collaborative governance, and transparent onchain/offchain coordination. This repository documents the conceptual, technical, and governance foundations of the AxoloDAO system.


## 🌎 Why AxoloDAO

AxoloDAO connects conservation actors, researchers, and communities around a shared mission:

- Democratize access to ecological and scientific data.
- Preserve the genetic diversity of native axolotl populations.
- Enable restoration of critical freshwater habitats.
- Build traceability and institutional trust through blockchain infrastructure.


## ⚠️ The Conservation Crisis of the Genus *Ambystoma*

Axolotl species face systemic threats:

- Habitat degradation and fragmentation  
- Water pollution  
- Fragmented research ecosystems  
- Restricted access to scientific data  
- Insufficient long-term funding models  

Mexico hosts 17 species of the genus *Ambystoma*, 16 of which are endemic. At least 9 species are categorized at maximum risk (CR or EN under IUCN criteria). The crisis extends beyond *Ambystoma mexicanum* (Xochimilco) and affects high-altitude freshwater systems across the country.

## ⛓️ Our Approach: Digital Public Infrastructure for Conservation

AxoloDAO treats conservation data as a shared public good.

We deploy decentralized infrastructure (Ethereum-based primitives, open attestations, transparent treasuries, standardized identifiers, and participatory governance) to coordinate science, communities, and institutions.

Our system proposes that conservation-relevant data—biological, environmental, genetic—should be:

- Recorded  
- Verified  
- Standardized  
- Publicly accessible  
- Cryptographically attributable  

Through this architecture, daily conservation operations become persistent, searchable records that enable:

- Research centers to demonstrate verifiable standards of care.
- Researchers to track phenotypes and longitudinal results.
- Donors to observe measurable impact.
- Communities to participate in oversight and governance.

Conservation becomes an open, transparent, and collaborative process.



## 🎯 Strategic objetives

### 1. Axolotl & Environment Data System

Onchain/offchain hybrid system for monitoring:

- Specimen-level biological data  
- Water parameters and environmental signals  
- Habitat metadata  
- Longitudinal phenotypic records  

Designed for interoperability and public verifiability.

### 2. Onchain Repository of Native Germplasm

Transparent provenance and lifecycle records for germplasm-related conservation processes, including:

- Lineage tracking  
- Institutional custody  
- Conservation attestations

### 3. Restoration Through MicroDAOs

Localized restoration initiatives coordinated through modular DAO structures that allow:

- Rapid iteration  
- Community governance  
- Transparent treasury management  
- Scalable replication  

## 🔗 Onchain Structure

AxoloDAO operates through ENS-based identities and modular organizational nodes.

### AxoloDAO Administration / [`axolodao.eth`](https://app.ens.domains/axolodao.eth)  
Primary administrative identity for onchain operations.

### AxoloDAO Treasury / [`treasury.axolodao.eth`](https://app.ens.domains/treasury.axolodao.eth)
Funds and consensus-oriented treasury identity for transparent resource management.
