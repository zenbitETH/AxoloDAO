# 🧬 AxoloDAO (WIP)

AxoloDAO is a **[microDAO](https://paragraph.com/@zenbit-2/how-to-onboard-startups-into-ethereum)** dedicated to advancing **[conservation and scientific research for Ambystoma species in Mexico](https://paragraph.com/@zenbit-2/we-are-axolodao)** through public digital infrastructure, collaborative governance, and transparent onchain/offchain coordination. This repository documents the conceptual, technical, and governance foundations of the AxoloDAO system.


## 🌎 1. Why AxoloDAO

AxoloDAO connects conservation actors, researchers, and communities around a shared mission:

- Democratize access to ecological and scientific data.
- Preserve the genetic diversity of native axolotl populations.
- Enable restoration of critical freshwater habitats.
- Build traceability and institutional trust through blockchain infrastructure.


## ⚠️ 2. The Conservation Crisis of the Genus *Ambystoma*

The genus *Ambystoma* encompasses approximately **32 salamander species across North America**, with **17 species in Mexico** and **16 endemic to the country**—representing over **50% of global genus diversity**. Despite this, Mexico contributes only a small fraction of global scientific publications on *Ambystoma* and holds no patents derived from its endemic biodiversity. The Mexican axolotl (*Ambystoma mexicanum*) alone accounts for a disproportionate share of worldwide research output, consolidating its role as a dominant biomedical model organism.

### 🌍 Systemic Extinction Pressures

The survival of Mexican *Ambystoma* species is threatened by:

- Habitat degradation and hydrological disruption  
- Water pollution and eutrophication  
- Invasive species (e.g., tilapia, carp)  
- Climate-driven ecosystem instability  
- Genetic fragmentation from isolated populations  

According to IUCN classifications, at least 9 Mexican endemic species are categorized as Critically Endangered, with additional taxa listed as Endangered. This means that a majority of endemic species face extremely high or very high extinction risk.

### 🧬 Global Research Imbalance

While *A. mexicanum* is globally recognized for its regenerative capabilities—regenerating limbs, spinal cord, cardiovascular tissue, and complex neural structures—most research infrastructure and funding is concentrated outside Mexico. This creates structural asymmetry between biological origin and scientific benefit.

AxoloDAO addresses this imbalance by building sovereign, transparent, and collaborative conservation infrastructure rooted in Mexico.


## ⛓️ 3. Our Approach: Digital Public Infrastructure for Conservation

AxoloDAO treats conservation data as a shared public good.

Our strategy is designed to correct informational fragmentation and institutional asymmetries that prevent coordinated, evidence-based conservation. We deploy decentralized infrastructure—Ethereum-based primitives, open attestations, transparent treasuries, standardized identifiers, and participatory governance—to interconnect science, communities, and institutions.

Conservation-relevant data—biological, environmental, genetic—must be:

- Recorded  
- Verified  
- Standardized  
- Publicly accessible  
- Cryptographically attributable  

Through this architecture, daily conservation operations become persistent, searchable records that enable:

- Research centers to demonstrate verifiable standards of care  
- Researchers to track longitudinal phenotypes and population dynamics  
- Donors to observe measurable environmental impact  
- Communities to participate in oversight and governance  

### ⚙️ Onchain Integration Layer

AxoloDAO leverages:

- **Smart contracts** to register specimens, habitats, and research metadata  
- **Onchain attestations** to validate provenance from accredited actors  
- **ENS-based decentralized identities** for institutions and conservation nodes  
- **Programmable treasuries (Safe)** for impact-based resource allocation  

By aligning verifiable data capture with governance and finance, conservation becomes transparent, auditable, and collaborative public infrastructure.

## 🎯 4. Strategic Objectives

### A. Axolotl & Environment Data System

A decentralized, interoperable registry integrating:

- Specimen-level biological data (taxonomy, reproductive data, phenotypes)  
- Habitat metadata and environmental signals (temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, GPS coordinates)  
- Population-level indicators (demography, eDNA-based metrics, genetic structure)  

This system reduces fragmentation by unifying reporting standards and enabling cross-site comparability over time.

### B. Onchain Repository of Native Germplasm

Global captive populations of multiple *Ambystoma* species — not only *A. mexicanum* — face varying degrees of genetic bottlenecks, habitat isolation, and population decline. While *A. mexicanum* represents the most internationally studied species, Mexico hosts 16 endemic *Ambystoma* taxa whose wild genetic diversity remains insufficiently documented, digitized, and protected.

AxoloDAO proposes a decentralized, species-wide germplasm repository designed to support **all Mexican *Ambystoma* species**, including critically endangered taxa such as *A. dumerilii*, *A. taylori*, *A. andersoni*, and others.

This biorepository framework includes:

- Ethical genomic and environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling compliant with national and international regulation  
- Whole-genome, transcriptomic, and population-level genetic references across endemic species  
- Distributed storage infrastructure (e.g., IPFS-based archives and redundant preservation layers)  
- Onchain provenance metadata linking specimens, habitats, and research actors  
- Participatory governance mechanisms to define access rights, benefit-sharing, and research coordination  

By expanding the repository beyond a single model organism, AxoloDAO reinforces biodiversity-level conservation, protects evolutionary lineages, and establishes sovereign digital stewardship over the full spectrum of Mexico’s endemic *Ambystoma* heritage.

### C. Restoration Through MicroDAOs

Localized restoration initiatives are coordinated through modular MicroDAOs that enable:

- Environmental monitoring through sensor-linked reporting  
- Transparent treasury management  
- Impact-based funding mechanisms  
- Community-level governance participation  

This model aligns financial incentives with measurable ecological outcomes and strengthens local custodianship.
